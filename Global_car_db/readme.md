##  Key Features
This database project includes well-structured relational models representing:

- **Customers** 
    - Track detailed customer profiles along with their purchase histories linked to specific car models.
- **CarModel** 
    - Capture car models, variant types, engine types, and associate them with production plants and timelines.
- **Maintenance records** 
    - Store and manage complete service logs for every vehicle, including service types, costs, and service dates.
- **Dealerships and sales**
    - Map vehicle sales to authorized dealerships, enabling regional performance analysis and sales reporting.
- **Plants and Features**
    - Link manufacturing plants with vehicles and define vehicle-specific features like sunroof, navigation system, etc.
- **Strong and Weak Entity Design**
    - Implements relationships such as Customer â†’ Vehicle and Vehicle â†’ Maintenance using appropriate ERD symbols.
- **Referential Integrity Using Keys**
   - Carefully defined primary and foreign key constraints for robust and scalable data consistency.

## Usage Examples

1. Get all car models manufactured by a specific manufacturer

```
SELECT MODEL_NAME, LAUNCH_YEAR, ENGINE_TYPE
FROM CARMODEL
JOIN MANUFACTURER ON CARMODEL.MANUFACTURER_ID = MANUFACTURER.MANUFACTURER_ID
WHERE MANU_NAME = 'Toyota';
```
2. Find total units sold and revenue for each model

```
SELECT CM.MODEL_NAME, SUM(S.UNIT_SOLD) AS TOTAL_UNITS, SUM(S.REVENUE) AS TOTAL_REVENUE
FROM SALES S
JOIN CARMODEL CM ON S.MODEL_ID = CM.MODEL_ID
GROUP BY CM.MODEL_NAME;

```
3. List customers and the features of the model they purchased

```
SELECT C.NAME AS CUSTOMER_NAME, CM.MODEL_NAME, F.FEATURE_NAME
FROM CUSTOMER C
JOIN CARMODEL CM ON C.MODEL_ID = CM.MODEL_ID
JOIN FEATURES F ON CM.MODEL_ID = F.MODEL_ID;

```
4. Get maintenance records for a particular customer
```
SELECT M.SERVICE_DATE, M.SERVICE_TYPE, M.COST
FROM MAINTAINANCE_RECORDS M
JOIN CUSTOMER C ON M.CUSTOMER_ID = C.CUSTOMER_ID
WHERE C.NAME = 'John Doe';

```
5. Show total revenue by region

```
SELECT REGION, SUM(REVENUE) AS TOTAL_REVENUE
FROM SALES
GROUP BY REGION;
```
